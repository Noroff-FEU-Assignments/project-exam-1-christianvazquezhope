## Description

This is a travel blog with content about Australia. My name is Christian Vazquez Hope, hence the name Hope Down Under.

Features I would like to implement in the future include, but are not limited to:

- Add a search and filter function
- Add an events calendar aggregating events from open APIs

## Built With

The website is built with clean HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. The blog posts are fetched from a WordPress REST API.
